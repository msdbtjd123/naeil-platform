It is a kit having a board on which light markings to indicate areas to paint, and each area has a number and a corresponding numbered paint to use. The kits come with little compartmentalised boxes where the numbered colour pigments are stored. The users are encouraged to wash the paintbrush every time a new numbered colour is being used.
